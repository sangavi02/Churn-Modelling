## Churn-Modelling
This project focuses on churn modelling for a bank, aiming to predict and analyze customer churn. Churn refers to the situation when customers stop using the services or products provided by a company. By understanding the factors contributing to churn, banks can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.
## Features
- **Data Collection:** Churn_Modelling.csv was used.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected data, handle missing values, and transform categorical variables into a suitable format for machine learning models.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features from the collected data that can be used as predictors for churn prediction, such as customer activity patterns, account usage statistics, and transactional behavior.
- **Model Training:** Utilize machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees,random forests,Support Vector Machine,Multi Layer Perceptron,Aritificial Neural Networks to build predictive models for churn identification.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the churn prediction models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Analyze the importance of different features in predicting churn to identify the key factors driving customer attrition.
- **Churn Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict churn for individual customers based on their historical data and provide a churn probability score.
- **Visualizations and Reports:** Generate visualizations and reports to summarize the findings, including churn rates, feature importance, and recommendations for customer retention strategies.
